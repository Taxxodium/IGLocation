# IGLocation

## To Build

- install cocoapods if you don't have them already
- in the project directory do: pod install
- open the .xcworkspace in Xcode
- Build & Run

## Usage

The first time you use the app, you should be asked to enter your Instagram credentials.
Once you've done that you will be taken to your image gallery.

Tap on a row to get a closer look at the item

In the Gallery there are few less obvious features:

- when you are at the top of the list, you can pull to refresh the entire gallery
- when nearing the end of the list, the app will automatically get more results (through pagination)
- if a post contains video, the video will autoplay in a loop (but muted)
- when looking at the detail of a post that contains an image, you can pinch to zoom
